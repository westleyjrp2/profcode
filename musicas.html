    <div>Oh, you got power, superpowers <br>
        Do you even know how to wield them?<br>
        All God's children are special<br>
        But not like you, no, not like you<br>
        You're just like a flower (flower)<br>
        You're ever-giving, that's a given
        All God's children (all God's children), are special (whoa)<br>
        But not like you, no, not like you<br>
        (Lift it, lift it, lift it)<br>
        Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)<br>
        (Lift it, lift it, lift it, lift it)<br>
        Mm, it's crazy to say this, but you're the greatest (you are the greatest)<br>
        Can't explain it (oh)<br>
        I know that you know the truth<br>
        They can't deny you, yeah, they can't deny you, it's true<br>
        Yeah, remember Vegas? You come a long way, kid<br>
        And let me just say this<br>
        Oh, yeah, you're the main character now<br>
        You're the main character now<br>
        (Lift it, lift it, lift it)<br>
        Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh, sky, sky)<br>
        (Lift it, lift it, lift it, lift it)<br>
        (You're the main character now)<br>
        (You're the main character now)<br>
        Oh, yeah<br></div>

        <div>I'm only human<br>
            I'm only, I'm only<br>
            I'm only human, human<br>
            Maybe I'm foolish<br>
            Maybe I'm blind<br>
            Thinking I can see through this<br>
            And see what's behind<br>
            Got no way to prove it<br>
            So maybe I'm blind<br>
            But I'm only human after all<br>
            I'm only human after all<br>
            Don't put your blame on me<br>
            Don't put your blame on me<br>
            Take a look in the mirror<br>
            And what do you see<br>
            Do you see it clearer<br>
            Or are you deceived<br>
            In what you believe<br>
            'Cause I'm only human after all<br>
            You're only human after all<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            Don't put your blame on me<br>
            Some people got the real problems<br>
            Some people out of luck<br>
            Some people think I can solve them<br>
            Lord heavens above<br>
            I'm only human after all<br>
            I'm only human after all<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            Don't ask my opinion<br>
            Don't ask me to lie<br>
            Then beg for forgiveness<br>
            For making you cry<br>
            Making you cry<br>
            'Cause I'm only human after all<br>
            I'm only human after all<br>
            Don't put your blame on me<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            Oh, some people got the real problems<br>
            Some people out of luck<br>
            Some people think I can solve them<br>
            Lord heavens above<br>
            I'm only human after all<br>
            I'm only human after all<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            I'm only human<br>
            I make mistakes<br>
            I'm only human<br>
            That's all it takes<br>
            To put the blame on me<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            I'm no prophet or Messiah<br>
            Should go looking somewhere higher<br>
            I'm only human after all<br>
            I'm only human after all<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            I'm only human<br>
            I do what I can<br>
            I'm just a man<br>
            I do what I can<br>
            Don't put the blame on me<br>
            Don't put your blame on me</div><br>

            <div>
                Na paisagem<br>
                Será magia, miragem, milagre<br>
                Será mistério<br>
                Prateando horizontes<br>
                Brilham rios, fontes<br>
                Numa cascata de luz<br>
                No espelho dessas águas<br>
                Vejo a face luminosa do amor<br>
                As ondas vão e vem<br>
                E vão e são como o tempo<br>
                Luz do divinal querer<br>
                Seria uma sereia ou seria só<br>
                Delírio tropical, fantasia<br>
                Ou será um sonho de criança<br>
                Sob o sol da manhã</div><br>
